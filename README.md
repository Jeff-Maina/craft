# CRAFT.

Craft is a simple minimal website that is made up of a collection of components created using react, tailwind css and framer motion for the interactive components.This project is my journey to understand the anatomy of different UI elements while also learning about responsiveness and accessibility.Similarly it is an archive of elements where one can simply copy and paste the components into their own projects.
